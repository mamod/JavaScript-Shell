=head1 NAME

JavaScript::Shell - Run Spidermonkey shell from Perl

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use JavaScript::Shell;
    use strict;
    use warnings;
    
    my $js = JavaScript::Shell->new();
    
    ##create context
    my $ctx = $js->createContext();
    
    $ctx->Set('str' => 'Hello');
    
    $ctx->Set('getName' => sub {
        my $context = shift;
        my $args    = shift;
        my $firstname = $args->[0];
        my $lastname  = $args->[1];
        return $firstname . ' ' . $lastname;
    });
    
    $ctx->eval(qq!
        function message (){
            var name = getName.apply(this,arguments);
            var welcome_message = str;
            return welcome_message + ' ' + name;
        }
    !);
    
    
    my $val = $ctx->get('message' => 'Mamod', 'Mehyar')->value;
    
    print $val . "\n"; ## prints 'Hello Mamod Mehyar'
    
    $js->destroy();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

JavaScript::Shell will turn Spidermonkey shell to an interactive environment
by connecting it to perl

With JavaScript::Shell you can bind functions from perl and call them from
javascript or create functions in javascript then call them from perl

=head1 WHY

While I was working on a project where I needed to connect perl with javascript
I had a lot of problems with existing javascript modules, they were eaither hard
to compile or out of date, so I thought of this approach as an alternative.

Even though this sounds crazy to do, to my surprise it worked as expected - at
least in my usgae cases

=head1 SPEED

JavaScript::Shell connect spidermonkey with perl through IPC bridge using
L<IPC::Open2> so execution speed will never be as fast as using C/C++
bindings ported to perl directly

There is another over head when translating data types to/from perl, since it
converts perl data to JSON & javascript JSON to perl data back again.

Saying that, the over all speed is acceptable and you can take some steps to
improve speed like

=over 4

=item Data Transfer

Try to transfer small data chunks between processes when possible, sending
large data will be very slow

=item Buffer Data

As of version 0.02 JavaScript::shell has a new method for dealing with large
strings passed to/from javascript, use this feature when ever you want to send
large data "strings" -- see C<buffer>

=item Minimize calls

Minimize number of calls to both ends, let each part do it's processing.
for eaxmple:

    ##instead of
    
    $js->eval(qq!
        function East (){}
        function West (){}
        function North (){}
        function South (){}
    !);
    
    $js->call('East');
    $js->call('West');
    $js->call('North');
    $js->call('South');
    
    ##do this
    
    $js->eval(qq!
        function all () {
            
            East();
            West();
            North();
            South();
            
        }
        
        function East (){}
        function west (){}
        function North (){}
        function South (){}
        
    !);
    
    $js->call('all');

=head1 CONTEXT

Once you intiate JavaScript::Shell you can create as many contexts
as you want, each context will has it's own scope and will not overlap
with other created contexts.

    my $js = JavaScript::Shell->new();
    my $ctx = $js->createContext();

You can pass a hash ref with simple data to C<createContext> method as a
sandbox object and will be copied to the context immediately

    my $ctx->createContext({
        Foo => 'Bar',
        Foo2 => 'Bar2'
    });

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 new

Initiates SpiderMonkey Shell

=head2 createContext

creates a new context

=head2 run

This will run javascript code in a blocking loop until you call jshell.endLoop()
from your javascript code

    $js->Set('Name' => 'XXX');
    $js->eval(qq!
        for (var i = 0; i < 100; i++){
            
        }
        
        jshell.endLoop();
        
    !);
    
    $js->run();
    
    ##will never reach this point unless we call
    ## jshell.endLoop(); in javascript code as above
    

=head2 Set

Sets/Defines javascript variables, objects and functions from perl
    
    ## set variable 'str' with Hello vales
    $ctx->Set('str' => 'Hello');
    
    ## set 'arr' Array Object [1,2,3,4]
    $ctx->Set('arr' => [1,2,3,4]);
    
    ## set Associated Array Object
    $ctx->Set('obj' => {
        str1 => 'something',
        str2 => 'something ..'
    });
    
    ## set 'test' function
    ## caller will pass 2 arguments
    ## 1- context object
    ## 2- array ref of all passed arguments
    $ctx->Set('test' => sub {
        my $context = shift;
        my $args = shift;
        
        return $args->[0] . ' ' . $args->[1];
    });
    
    ## javascript object creation style
    
    $ctx->Set('obj' => {});
    
    #then
    $ctx->Set('obj.name' => 'XXX');
    $ctx->Set('obj.get' => sub { });
    ...

=head2 get

get values from javascript code, returns a C<JavaScript::Shell::Value> Object
    
    my $ret = $ctx->get('str');
    print $ret->value; ## Hello
    
    ## remember to call value to get the returned string/object
    
get method will search your context for a matched variable/object/function and
return it's value, if the name was detected for a function it will run this
function first and then returns it's return value
    
    $ctx->get('obj.name')->value; ## XXX
    
    ##you can pass variables when trying to get a function
    $ctx->get('test' => 'Hi','Bye')->value; ## Hi Bye
    
    ##get an evaled script values
    
    $ctx->get('eval' => qq!
        var n = 2;
        var x = 3;
        n+x;
    !)->value;  #--> 5
    
    
=head2 call

Calling javascript functions from perl, same as C<get> but doesn't return any
value

    $ctx->call('test');

=head2 eval

eval javascript code

    $ctx->eval(qq!
        
        //javascript code
        var n = 10;
        for(var i = 0; i<100; i++){
            n += 10;
        }
        ...
    !);
    
=head2 buffer

This function should be used only when dealing with passing large strings

    $js->Set('largeStr' => sub{
        
        my $js = shift;
        my $args = shift;
        
        ##we have a very large string we need to pass to
        ##javascript
        
        return $js->buffer('large string');
        
    });
    
    
    ##javascript
    var str = largeStr();
    

The same thing can be done when sending large strings from javascript to perl

    //javascript
    
    var str = 'very large string we need to pass to perl';
    jshell.sendBuffer(str);
    
    ##perl
    ##to consume this string from perl just get it
    my $str = $js->getBuffer();    
    
=head2 onError

set error handler method, this method accepts a code ref only. When an error
raised from javascript this code ref will be called with 2 arguments

=over 4

=item * JavaScript::Shell instance

=item * error object - Hash ref

=back

Error Hash has the folloing keys

=over 4

=item * B<message>  I<error message>

=item * B<type>     I<javascript error type: Error, TypeError, ReferenceError ..>

=item * B<file>     I<file name wich raised this error>

=item * B<line>     I<line number>

=item * B<stack>    I<string of the full stack trace>

=back

Setting error hnadler example

    my $js = JavaScript::Shell->new();
    $js->onError(sub{
        my $self = shift;
        my $error = shift;
        print STDERR $error->{message} . ' at ' . $error->{line}
        exit(0);
    });

=head2 destroy

Destroy javascript shell / clear context

    my $js = JavaScript::Shell->new();
    my $ctx->createContext();
    
    ##clear context;
    $ctx->destroy();
    
    ##close spidermonkey shell
    $js->destroy();
